      "@@ Introduction\n",
      "Apple pie is a classic dessert that is enjoyed by many people around the world. It is a delicious combination of sweet apples, buttery crust, and a hint of cinnamon. Making an apple pie from scratch can be a daunting task, but with the right ingredients and techniques, anyone can make a delicious apple pie in their own home. In this course, we will discuss the steps needed to make an apple pie from scratch, including selecting the right ingredients, preparing the crust, and baking the pie. \n",
      "\n",
      "@@ Selecting the Right Ingredients\n",
      "The first step in making an apple pie is selecting the right ingredients. Apples are the star of the show, so it is important to choose apples that are sweet and firm. Granny Smith apples are a popular choice for apple pies because they are tart and hold their shape when cooked. Other good options include Honeycrisp, Braeburn, and Golden Delicious apples. In addition to apples, you will need butter, sugar, flour, cinnamon, and salt for the crust and filling. \n",
      "\n",
      "@@ Preparing the Crust\n",
      "Once you have gathered all of your ingredients, it is time to prepare the crust. Start by combining the flour, salt, and butter in a food processor until it resembles coarse crumbs. Then add cold water one tablespoon at a time until the dough comes together. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and wrap each piece in plastic wrap. Place the dough in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before rolling it out. \n",
      "\n",
      "@@ Rolling Out the Dough\n",
      "When you are ready to roll out the dough, lightly flour your work surface and rolling pin. Place one of the pieces of dough on the floured surface and roll it out until it is about 1/8 inch thick. Carefully transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie plate and press it into place. Trim any excess dough from around the edges of the plate with a knife or kitchen scissors. \n",
      "\n",
      "@@ Making the Filling\n",
      "To make the filling for your apple pie, start by peeling and slicing your apples into thin slices. Place them in a large bowl and add sugar, cinnamon, and salt to taste. Mix everything together until all of the apples are evenly coated with sugar and spices. \n",
      "\n",
      "@@ Assembling and Baking\n",
      "Once you have prepared your crust and filling, it is time to assemble your pie. Start by pouring your filling into the prepared crust. Dot with butter if desired. Place your second piece of dough on top of your filling and trim any excess dough from around the edges of your plate with a knife or kitchen scissors. Crimp or flute the edges of your crust to seal in all of your delicious filling. Finally, cut several slits in top of your pie to allow steam to escape while baking. Bake at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for 45-50 minutes or until golden brown on top. \n",
      "\n",
      "@@ Conclusion \n",
      "Making an apple pie from scratch can be a daunting task but with these steps anyone can make a delicious apple pie in their own home! Start by selecting sweet and firm apples such as Granny Smiths or Honeycrisps for your filling. Prepare your crust by combining flour, salt, butter, and cold water in a food processor until it resembles coarse crumbs.
